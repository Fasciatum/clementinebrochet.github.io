                    This short experimental film explores the aesthetic of corals' death through a reflection on human behaviour.
                    Particularly stressed by the increasing ocean heat and its acidification, the corals don't have time to adapt. In an attempt to survive, they produce brightly coloured chimicals in their flesh and start to glow. Powerless, they finally bleach and die. The disappearance of corals has a global impact: they serve as home and breeding site to 25% of marine species and 500 millions of people depend on their ressources (food, shield against erosion of the costs, tourism, etc.)

                    I combined my shots with stock footage from David Hannan (underwater DOP), The Ocean Agency, as well as film's extracts from the documentary <i>Chasing Coral</i> (2017) directed by Jeff Orlowski.
